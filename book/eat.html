        <h1>Eat Pray Love</h1>
        <h2>By Elizabeth Gilbert</h2>

            I’m going to go with the classic good-bad-ugly format for this review, with an added caveat to open.

            This book excites a lot of ideological debate. These are my views, not those of Nevins Library, and they’re not meant to be taken as a personal attack on a lifestyle, a person, or a set of beliefs. What  I write here is nothing more or less than my opinion of a piece of popular literature.

            Eat, Pray, Love is famous enough that most people are familiar with the basic concept: Elizabeth Gilbert goes around the world to enjoy good food, spend time on her spiritual development, and fall in love. Falling in love isn’t explicitly part of the plan, but she does have in mind the idea that she’ll get over her divorce and most recent heartbreak by spending a year away from New York.        </p>

            As Aomame’s and Tengo’s narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector.

            A love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George Orwell’s—1Q84 is Haruki Murakami’s most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant best seller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers.
